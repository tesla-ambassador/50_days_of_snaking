# Your new company has a list of figures saved in a list. The issue is that these numbers have no separator. 
# The numbers are saved in the following format:
# [1000000, 2356989, 2354672, 9878098].
# You have been asked to write a code that will convert each of the numbers in the list into a string. 
# Your code should then add a comma on each number as a thousand separator for readability. 
# When you run your code on the above list, your output should be:
# [ '1,000,000', '2,356,989', '2,354,672', '9,878,098â€™]
# Write a function called convert_numbers that will take one argument, a list of numbers above.
